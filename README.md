# SILICON-ON-INSULATOR-SOI-FINFET-USING-SENTAURUS-TCAD
Design, simulate and Analyze Silicon on Insulator (SOI) FinFet using Sentaurus TCAD Software.

FinFET:
1) It stands as a Fin Field effect transistor.
2) Traditionally used transistors like MOSFET have a planar structure where the
gate is on top of the channel and controls the current flow from a single direction.
3) FinFET has a three-dimensional silicon channel or the fin with the gate wrapped
around it. In such a structure the gate channel interface is large and the gate
controls the current flow from three directions hence improving the overall control.
4) The FinFET with gate on three sides of the channel is also called trigate or
triple-gate SOI FinFET. SOI stands for Silicon on oxide where the fin is built on an
oxide layer that is deposited on the substrate to provide insulation and reduce
leakage current.
